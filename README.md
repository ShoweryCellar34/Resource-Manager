# What is Resource Mannager?

Resource Manager is a very basic file resource manager, probaly won't get documentation or updates. This is mostly just for use in my other projects.

## Platform support

Resource Manager just uses CXX standard libraries and [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and is tested on Arch linux with Hyprland and Windows 11/10.

## How to clone

Run this command with [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed to clone this repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ShoweryCellar34/Resource-Manager.git`

## How to build \(CMake required\)

### [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
1. Move into the cloned directory `cd Resource-Manager`.
2. Make the build directory `mkdir build` and move into it `cd build`.
3. Generate the project file `cmake ..`.
4. Build with `cmake --build .`
5. Run the produced `Resource-Manager` file.
